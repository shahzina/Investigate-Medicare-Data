# Investigate Medicare Dataset from 2014

This project explores and analyses health data from 2014 focussing on the home health agencies that provide medicare services. The dataset provides us information about the providers such as their names and geographical locations but it also describes patient-related data like, LUPA and non-LUPA beneficiaries, categorizing patients according to their race and diseases, etc..The datasets were procured from kaggle and then cleaned and downloaded from there using google BigQuery, all other cleaning and wrangling was done in a jupyter notebook.  

Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, uszipcode library, scipy and gmaps are the tools used to analyze the data. The file "Project 1- code" has the code used for data exploration and visualization and the file "Project 1- essay" has the explanation and inferences from the resulting data, charts and graphs.
